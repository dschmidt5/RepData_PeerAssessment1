## Loading and preprocessing the data
##### 1. Load the data (i.e. read.csv())

```r
echo = TRUE
activityData <- read.csv('activity.csv')
library(ggplot2)
```
##### 2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

```r
activityData$interval <- strptime(gsub("([0-9]{1,2})([0-9]{2})", "\\1:\\2", activityData$interval), format='%H:%M')
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

##### 1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

```r
aggStepsByDay <- tapply(activityData$steps, activityData$date, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
```

##### 2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```r
qplot(aggStepsByDay, xlab='Total Steps(per day)', ylab='Frequency', main = 'Total Steps per Day', binwidth = 500)
```

##### 3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```r
stepsByDayMean <- mean(aggStepsByDay)
stepsByDayMean
stepsByDayMedian <- median(aggStepsByDay)
stepsByDayMedian
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
##### 1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```r
avgStepsPerInterval <- aggregate(x = list(AvgSteps=activityData$steps), by = list(Interval = activityData$interval), FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
ggplot(data = avgStepsPerInterval, aes(x = Interval, y = AvgSteps)) +
    geom_line() +
    xlab('5-minute Interval') +
    ylab('Average Number of Steps') +
    ggtitle('Average Number of Steps for 5-minute Interval') 

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
